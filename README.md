<h2> A Day During MCO </h2>
<h3> 18th April 2020 </h3>
<p> I always started my day at 9.00 a.m. I woke up and took my breakfast. Then, I help my litle cousins with their studies. </p><img src="books.jpg" alt="books" width="250" height="250">
<p> After that, I cooked lunch for my family. After cooking, we eat together. Then, I took a break. During my rest time, usually I watch k-drama or k-show. That day, I watched K-drama titled A Piece of Your Mind. After sometime, my mom called me and requested for dalgona coffee. She said she was craving for it. So, I get out of my room and head to the kitchen to make her dalgona coffee. At the same time, my mom baked some cake for our tea time. </p><img src="dalgona-coffee.jpg" alt="dalgona-coffee" width="300" height="300">
<p> My family have a lot of pets. My favourite is puppies. So, I always play with my puppies during the recreation time. That evening, I play with my puppies for more that 30 minutes then I went in to the house and started to karaoke. I loves singing and I think I sing almost everyday at home. That day I mostly sing Korean song. I love Korean old songs.</p><img src="IMG_20200325_161453.jpg" alt="IMG_20200325_161453" width="250" height="250">
<p> Then I cleaned myself and took my dinner. After dinner I do my homeworks. Lastly, it is my healing time before I sleep. My healing time is filled with inspirational song. Mostly Korean old song because I like their lyrics as it feels like the song talk to me. </p>
<p> This is one of the song that I listen the most. This is actually Korean song but in English version. The title is A Flying Butterfly by YB </p>
